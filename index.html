        <p>
          <em>I am a historian specialized in the history of medicine, plants, and food in Japan.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          I was always interested in herbs and foreign languages/cultures, but it would have never come into my mind to study Japanese had I not discovered, by chance, that Tübingen University offered courses in Japanese culture and languages (modern and premodern). 
          After an exchange year in Tokyo and graduation in Japanese studies (M.A.), I found myself in Japan again, this time not as a student, but language teacher for German at Ritsumeikan University in Kyoto. 
          During these years I not only emerged myself into teaching and co-writing a textbook for intermediate German, but also embarked on a journey into the world of herbs and healing. 
          I started to learn Japanese and Chinese acupuncture and shiatsu, which – back in Germany – resulted in a license as Certified Non-Medical Practitioner (HeilpraktikerIn) and occupation in own practice. 
        </p>
        <p>
          But the deep interest in finding out how treatment with herbs, plants, and other methods were applied in the past pulled me back to the desk.
          During my year as a postgraduate at Tsukuba University, I found an intriguing emergency manual named <em>Kōkei saikyūhō</em> from the late eighteenth century, which eventually led me to the University of Cambridge to pursue a PhD in the history of medicine in Japan. 
          The findings from my dissertation drove/encouraged me to further explore if and how traditional healing methods and remedies changed over time.
        </p>
        <p> 
          What originally started as a small side project in which I investigated into the healing properties of food, namely the Japanese radish (daikon), ushered into a larger study that reveals not only the daikon's role as a healing agent but its enormous influence in having shaped Japan's culture profoundly. 
          Parts of my discoveries are summarized in an article and at my website <a href="https://daikonandbeyond.com">daikonandbeyond</a>.
